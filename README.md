NotionWidgets is a side project just to see if I can make HTML- and React-based widgets that will show up in non-code environments like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Dashy App](https://www.dashyapp.com/), a Chrome homepage extension for productivity.

My first one is a TradingView widget that shows my favorite crypto & stock tickers: BTC, ETH, SOL, SHIB, BONK, TSLA

If you somehow find this, please know this is a huge WIP and is not intended to be in any sort of hyperpolished state at any time!
